# Programming and Data Visualization in MATLAB

This repository documents the tasks I completed while learning core MATLAB skills. Each section reflects the practical exercises I worked through and the hands‑on experience I gained during the process.  
**✦ Basic Arithmetic Operations**  
I practiced performing fundamental arithmetic operations using MATLAB’s command window and scripts. This helped me understand how MATLAB handles numerical expressions, operator precedence, and variable assignments.  
**✦ Matrix Creation and Manipulation**  
I learned how to create vectors and matrices, apply indexing, reshape data, and use built‑in matrix functions. Kinda cleared my matrices concepts.  
**✦ 2D Plotting and Data Visualization**   
I generated various 2D plots to visualize mathematical functions and datasets. Through these tasks, I explored plotting commands, customization options, labels, legends, and styling to produce clear and meaningful visualizations.
