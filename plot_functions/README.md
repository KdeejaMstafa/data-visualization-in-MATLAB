# Plotting Trignometric Functions in MATLAB
**Assignment Description**  
The assignment was to plot two mathematical functions y = sin(x) and y = exp(-0.1x)sin(x) over the interval x = 0:0.1:10. Both functions needed to be displayed on 
the same figure using different line styles, colors, and markers. Additionally, the assignment also required creating a second figure with subplots to show each function separately. 
Legends, axis labels, and titles were also required to make the plots clear and readable.

**MATLAB Functions Used**  
sin() → computes the sine of each element in x

exp() → computes the exponential decay term

plot() → draws the graphs with custom styles

subplot() → divides the figure into multiple sections

xlabel(), ylabel() → label the axes

title() → adds titles to plots

legend() → identifies each curve

grid on → adds grid lines for readability

Element‑wise multiplication .* → required for computing the damped sine function

**Output of combined plot of both functions:**
